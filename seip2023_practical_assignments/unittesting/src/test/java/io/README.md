# Purpose of FileIOTest

## Tests the funcionality of FileIO by Testing with test cases: 

###  This includes a normal case where a file with numbers is read successfully, as well as two cases where IllegalArgumentException is expected. The test files should be placed in the src/test/resources directory.
 
#### Some of the tests are:
- the normal case of reading a file.
- the case of reading an empty file.
- the case of reading a non-existent file.
- the case of reading a file containing invalid entries.
