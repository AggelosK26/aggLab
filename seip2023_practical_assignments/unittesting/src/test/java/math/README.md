# Purpose of each test case

## AllTests

### This class serves as a test suite for running all the tests in the math package.

## ArithmeticOperationsTest

### Provides test cases for both normal and edge cases to test the funcionality of divide and multiply methods

## ArrayOperationsTest

### Uses Mockito to mock the FileIO and MyMath instances passed as parameters to the method. This allows you to isolate and test the behavior of the method without relying on actual dependencies.

## FactorialParameterizedTest

### This test class enables testing the factorial method in the MyMath class with multiple input values and expected results, ensuring that the method produces the correct factorial calculation for each input

## MyMathTest  

###  This test class verifies the correctness and behavior of the factorial and isPrime methods in the MyMath class, including handling edge cases such as negative numbers, out-of-range values, prime numbers, and numbers less than 2.
